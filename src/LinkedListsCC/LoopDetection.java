/*    2.8 Loop Detection: Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the
    beginning of the loop.
    DEFINITION
    Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so
    as to make a loop in the linked list.
    EXAMPLE
    Input: A - > B - > C - > D - > E - > C [the same C as earlier]
    Output: C

    This is a modification of a classic interview problem: detect if a linked list has a loop. Let's apply the Pattern
    Matching approach.
    An easy way to detect if a linked list has a loop is through the FastRunner / SlowRunner approach.
    Floydâ€™s Cycle finding algorithm:
    (m + n*x + k) = 2*(m + n*y + k)
    Note that before meeting the point shown above, fast
    was moving at twice speed.

    x -->  Number of complete cyclic rounds made by
           fast pointer before they meet first time
    y -->  Number of complete cyclic rounds made by
           slow pointer before they meet first time
    m + k = (x-2y)*n
    Which means m+k is a multiple of n.
    So if we start moving both pointers again at same speed such that one pointer (say slow) begins
     from head node of linked list and other pointer (say fast) begins from meeting point. When slow
     pointer reaches beginning of loop (has made m steps), fast pointer would have made also moved m steps
     as they are now moving same pace. Since m+k is a multiple of n and fast starts from k, they would meet
     at the beginning. Can they meet before also? No because slow pointer enters the cycle first time after m steps.
