/*5.4 Next Number: Given a positive integer, print the next smallest and the next largest number that
have the same number of 1 bits in their binary representation.
pg 116
SOLUTION
There are a number of ways to approach this problem, including using brute force, using bit manipulation,
and using clever arithmetic. Note that the arithmetic approach builds on the bit manipulation approach.
You'll want to understand the bit manipulation approach before going on to the arithmetic one.
The Brute Force Approach
An easy approach is simply brute force: count the number of ls in n, and then increment (or decrement)
until you find a number with the same number of ls. Easy-but not terribly interesting. Can we do something
a bit more optimal? Yes!
