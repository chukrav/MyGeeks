/*4.9 BST Sequences: A binary search tree was created by traversing through an array from left to right
and inserting each element. Given a binary search tree with distinct elements, print all possible
arrays that could have led to this tree.
EXAMPLE
Input: 2 -root, 1 - left, 3 - right: missed -> _
Tree: 2, 1, 3
Output: {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}

Example2, Tree: 50, 20, 60, 10, 25, 70, 5, 15, 65, 80
